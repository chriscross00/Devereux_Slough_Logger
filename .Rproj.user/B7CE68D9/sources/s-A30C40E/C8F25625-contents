Personal Outline:

1. Introducion to DS
    * Background of location
    Devereux Slough is a temporary closed/open estuary (TOCE) off of the Santa Barbara Channel. It is located within the Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR), a University of California Natural Reserve and managed by the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Along with the slough, COPR also manages Sands Beach which sits just meters away from Devereux Slough. This is thought to be a major source of water for the estury, though this has changed with the connection of Devereux Slough to North Campus Open Space (NCOS). 
A untested hypothesis is that Devereux Slough's daily water level changes are caused by tidal movements. 
    * Ecological importance
    In general estuaries are 1 of the most productive aquatic systems in the world. Devereux Slough fits the definition of a temporary closed/open estuary. This means that for part of the year it is open to inputs of water and  the rest of the year it is closed to inputs of water. Inputs of water in this context refers to bodies of watr and importantly exclude percipitation. For Devereux Slough it is closed for most of year, only open when it breaches during the winter, for a couple of days. This occurs when Devereux Slough fills up to a critical level from winter percipitation that water will flow over the sand berm and into Sands Beach, ultimately flowing into the Pacific Ocean. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUcGfp0blE) of this event show just how violent flowing water can be.
    
    * Lack of previous research
    A PhD thesis by Darcy Goodman examined Devereux Slough in a holistic sense, especially focussing on the fish diversity and management of the reserve. In addition to her thesis, Goodman estiblished a similar monitoring program, however that ended a couple years after starting. The lack of long-term ecological data is concerning on its own. However, with th recent major changes in the area, namely the connection of Devereux Slough to NCOS, monitoring Devereux Slough becomes more a of a pressing issue. We have already seen impacts to Devereux Slough from NCOS.
    
In the larger ecological context, there is little scientific literature on TOCE in North America, most of the literature reflects TOCE in South Africa. 
2. Introduction to data
    * Collection method
    The Pier is one of three sites that we conducted consistently and is the deepest of all the sites, with consistent depths of over 1.5 meters. Data was collected via data loggers deployed off the Pier.  The loggers recorded data every 15 minutes, which amounts to 96 data points per day. We retrieved the data and performed maintaince on the loggers every 2 weeks. This took roughly 2 hours, which explains some of the gaps in the data. 
    * Expected trends
    Santa Barbara's climate is classified as a Mediterranean climate, characterized with warm, dry summers and mild winters. Little if any percipitation occurs outside of winter and annual percipitation is around 0.5 m per year. Because of this we can hypothesize some general water level trends. We would expect water level to be highest during the winters and decrease throughout the years, with the lowest points during the summer months, June through August.
